Loading data into Hive Tables:
------------------------------
We can load data from local file system / Distributed file system into Hive Table:
>LOAD DATA [LOCAL] INPATH 'employees' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE employees PARTITION (country = 'US', state = 'CA');

Inserting data into tables from queries:
>INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE employees PARTITION (country = 'US', state = 'OR') SELECT * FROM staged_employees se WHERE se.cnty = 'US' AND se.st = 'OR';

Creating Tables and Loading Them in One Query:
> CREATE TABLE ca_employees AS SELECT name, salary, address FROM employees WHERE se.state = 'CA';




Exporting Data:
--------------------------------
>INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/tmp/ca_employees' SELECT name, salary, address FROM employees WHERE se.state = 'CA';
