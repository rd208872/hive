=================

 Partitions with internal/managed tables:
To create partition while creating the table:
 CREATE TABLE employees (name STRING, salary FLOAT, subordinates ARRAY<STRING>, deductions MAP<STRING, FLOAT>, address STRUCT<street:STRING, city:STRING, state:STRING,  
zip:INT>) PARTITIONED BY (country STRING, state STRING);
 
 To show the partitions:
 > SHOW PARTITIONS employees ;
 > SHOW PARTITIONS employees PARTITION(country='countryName');
 
 Partitions with external tables:
 CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE xyz ( hms INT, severity STRING, server STRING, process_id INT, message STRING) PARTITIONED BY (year INT, month INT, day INT) ROW FORMAT  
DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t';
 
 Alter table to add partitions:
 ALTER TABLE tableName ADD PARTITION(year = 2012, month = 1, day = 2)
 
 Alter table to drop partitions:
 ALTER TABLE log_messages DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION(year = 2011, month = 12, day = 2);
